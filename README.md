### hey there, I’m Prakhar 👋

💻 CS, Math, Econ @ Amherst College  
🤖 Builder of real-time voice agents, trading bots, and systems that (actually) scale  
🌍 Visting Student at UC Berkeley for Spring 2025 soaking in sun, systems, and startups

### 🛠️ what I’ve been up to

- 🗣️ building a voice agent that thinks, speaks, and responds — in real time (Deepgram + GPT + Cartesia)
- 📈 creating mean-reverting pairs trading strategies using ML (KNN, LSTM, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- 🚀 optimizing ML pipelines using CUDA & RapidsAI for high-performance computing research
- 🔐 securing distributed file systems (with cryptography, not duct tape)
- 🧠 coaching peers on time management and study skills at Amherst’s Strategic Learning Center

---

### ⚡ a few favorite things

- Systems programming, but make it fast  
- Real-time AI (latency makes me twitchy)  
- Quant finance (because math should move markets)  
- Hackathons, late-night debugging, and building things that surprise even me
